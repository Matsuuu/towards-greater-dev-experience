# Towards greater development experience through Web Platform API's

Talk material for the presentation


<blockquote>
Web Development has come a long way. From importing singular global scripts like jQuery to packaging your React projects into bundles to ES Modules. At the same time, support for more modular approaches for website development have surfaced. 

In this talk we will be exploring how developers can utilize these new platform API's to create modular building blocks for their site, while remaining completely buildless and in-browser.

After this talk you'll be equipped with knowledge on some of the latest web platform API's inluding but not limited to - Web Components / Custom Elements - ES Modules - Import Maps - CSS Modules 

With these tools in your toolbox, you'll be able to ship more ease-of-use and value to your customers in your web projects.
